# AMJ Culture — design and first acceptance

## Development purpose, phase and priority (2026-10-16 review)

Culture's product goal is to remove historically incongruous **character generation, culturally contingent mood/social judgments, and intoxicant gameplay** from ancient-to-medieval Japanese settlement play **without breaking the useful Vanilla/MO gameplay roles**. One neutral meal Thought is a small completed slice, not the product goal. Culture combines Backstories, generic Pawn-generation interactions, Traits, relevant Needs/Thoughts and psychoactive Drug/effect/supply UX; Shared Sleeping, general furniture, medicinal remedies, brewing, and ordinary food Jobs remain other owners' responsibilities.

**Actual implementation maturity:** only the narrow `AteWithoutTable` zero-mood XML prototype has accepted detailed behavior and source. Its static XML check passed; no loaded-game acceptance exists. Historical background/trait handling, drugs and minimum enza functionality have *approved ownership/boundaries or research candidates*, but **not** complete per-feature effect values, spawn handling, recipes, migration or final implementation specifications. Do not describe Culture overall as implemented or entering integration validation.

**Next Culture specification work:** prioritize the user's high-execution-impact historical drug/intoxicant UX together with related `DrugDesire`/Need/Trait rules. Preserve the emergency mood-rescue role, addiction/withdrawal consistency and existing-save references. In the same bounded character-generation design effort, resolve the evidenced `Transhumanist` natural and forced-Backstory paths in Vanilla/MO, without indiscriminate TraitDef deletion or re-auditing all third-party backgrounds. Work from the existing Project [drug research](https://github.com/sucRo-RimWorld/Ancient-Medieval-Japan-Project/blob/main/Docs/Research/PsychoactiveSubstancesCandidate.md) and [character research](https://github.com/sucRo-RimWorld/Ancient-Medieval-Japan-Project/blob/main/Docs/Research/CultureCandidate.md); make each accepted final decision here before adding its source. Enza material/Comfort/job adapter and broader ethics/other backgrounds remain separate later decisions without fixed next-task precedence. This local sequencing does **not** override the Project-wide P0 Environment/Grains repair and closeout work. The approved drug UX review has elevated execution priority ahead of new Ironmaking expansion; general Culture reconstruction classification remains P2.

**Validation timing:** keep the acceptance contract below as a *future promotion gate*, not the current development task. Defer the dedicated Culture 1.6 Vanilla/MO E2E harness, 1.7 compatibility checks, CI construction and broad regression matrix until a coherent implemented behavior requires those checks or a concrete unknown blocks its design. A single narrowly scoped loaded-Def check is permissible if needed to resolve a specific implementation ambiguity. Do not repeat retired stool demonstrations, grow tests to justify the runner infrastructure, or promote source parsing to runtime PASS. Do not publish the unaccepted prototype.

## Scope of this prototype

This first source-only prototype changes **only** the existing `AteWithoutTable` Thought mood stage to `0`. Preserve the same ThoughtDef identity; do not add a compensating mood buff, hide a zero-effect memory from the UI, or alter the food Job, seating, rooms, nutrition, filth, and other Thoughts.

The independently designed historically appropriate **enza (円座)** floor seat / actual Comfort mechanic is a separate future implementation unit, not in this change. Culture remains standalone and does not require MO, any VE content pack, Picnic Area or another furniture Mod. The broader integrated Culture scope (Backstories, Traits, drugs) is planned but not implemented in this prototype.

Background and prior-art/need audit: [Project Culture candidate specification](https://github.com/sucRo-RimWorld/Ancient-Medieval-Japan-Project/blob/main/Docs/Research/CultureCandidate.md). That document is a staging reference; the owner repository takes over accepted implementation and version-specific validation when bootstrapped.

## Acceptance contract

1. Real original RimWorld 1.6 Vanilla and Vanilla+MO loaded `ThoughtDef=AteWithoutTable`: patch operation targets existing stage(s), and resulting mood effect is exactly `0`; no patch operation error.
2. An actual meal without an eating table no longer causes a negative mood effect from `AteWithoutTable`, and creates no replacement positive buff. Record whether an inert memory remains in the Needs UI separately; this is not a release blocker for the narrow patch.
3. Standard tables/seats and actual Comfort gain are unchanged; a normal impressive dining room still awards the standard positive Thought when the unmodified game would award it.
4. Other food-quality, dirty food/filth, nutrition and environmental penalties remain unchanged.
5. Native test log is complete, with zero attributable runtime ERRORs, explicit exact game/Mod source and test profile; original game files, installed providers, saves and player ModsConfig must not be modified.
6. RimWorld 1.7 compatibility is unclaimed until its own actual loaded-Def and real-meal checks pass. Only then expand `supportedVersions`.

Do not substitute XML parsing or the Project's retired stool proof-of-concept for tests (1)–(6). Avoid re-running the retired test-only research fixture.

## Static source contract

`Patches/AteWithoutTable.xml` contains exactly one `PatchOperationReplace` aimed at `Defs/ThoughtDef[defName="AteWithoutTable"]/stages/li/baseMoodEffect`, with a single `baseMoodEffect` element and text `0`. `About/About.xml` declares only RimWorld `1.6` until runtime validation.

**Status (2026-10-16):** Source-only, XML static validation. No actual native 1.6/1.7 loaded-game or gameplay evidence; not approved for Workshop publication.
